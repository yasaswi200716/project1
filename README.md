#UID PROJECT PHASE_I
to this I had designed a portifolio consisting of :
#HEADER SECTION
#NAVIGATION BAR
it includes sections :about,projects,achievements,contact,resume.

****I used multi html pages (multi-page-site) to open various sections in different tabs so that user may experience clean and clear information about me****
#SECTION BAR
##ABOUT contains my profile photo and my description.
##PROJECTS contains the details of my  project such as title and short description and a ppt regarding project.
##ACHIEVEMENTS contains title and description and also the certificate.
##CONTACT contains my ids from various socialmedia to interact with me.
##RESUME consists of my resume sheet.

#FOOTER SECTION
it includes copyright information.
***********************************************************************************************
I uploaded all the required files such as my image , workshop certificate, project ppt,resume pdf  and all html files and a single style file.

#Walkthrough of my stylesheet
->Profile-Pic 
I used properties like height, width, I made border-radius to be circle,and top and bottom margin, transition and included hover effect using transform property.
-> Navigation Bar
I removed bullets using list-style property, and made it to be horixontal and centered spaced out evenly using diplay, justify-content,gap,flex-wrap properties. 
I used hover effects to get golden color on the elements when curser moves on it.
->Section Content
I used padding and text-align and fade-In animation.
->Project and Achievement 
I implemente Bright yellow button with dark text, hovering darkens the color and enlarges it slightly.
->Footer
It sticks to the bottom and spans full-width.
Same dark purple theme as the header.
->Animations
I added fade-in effect which are being used in sections.
->Responsive Design
